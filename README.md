I'm struggling to get this code to work , particularly the api and deleting favorite items
I've searched online and I still cant figure out how to get the api to work , I keep getting undefined values
I plan on implementing more functionality to the application once I can get the api and deleting part working


To run this code:
1. cd backend
2. npm install
3. npm start
4. cd frontend
5. npm install
6. npm start
7. http://localhost:3000
